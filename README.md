## Start with:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\polyglotter_0.1b.ps1
```

## Usage:
1. Choose a *.hta or other file with your playload vbs script etc... (you can example_payload.hta use for testing)
2. Click Start Script Button and enjoy the "Chrome.lnk" file on your Desktop
3. If you wish some other Output name just change it on the Input field below Start Script



## If you don't choose a file in 1. there will be some dummy code generated!

Have fun.
